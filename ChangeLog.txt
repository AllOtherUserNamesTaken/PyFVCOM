--------

Add a few new functions, expand some others (maintaining backward
compatibility) and fix some bugs.

cst_tools:
    * writeCST: New function to write out a CST file for a given set of arcs.
grid_tools:
    * Remove unused import math.
    * lineSample: Fix (in a manner of speaking) a bug when creating a transect
    through an unstructured grid.
    * connectivity: Fix docstring to be correct for one of the outputs.
ocean_tools:
    * zbar: Add support for time varying arrays.
    * pea: Add support for time varying arrays.
    * simpsonhunter: New function to calculate the Simpson-Hunter parameter
    for some velocity and depth data.
    * mixedlayerdepth: New function to calculate the mixed layer depth (as
    defined in ERSEM).
    * stokes: Initial attempt at calculating the Stokes number as a predictor
    of front locations (in the same vein as simpsonhunter). As yet unfinished
    but may be useful to someone as is.
read_FVCOM_results:
    * readFVCOM: Add support for exporing the global attributes from a netCDF
    file.
    * ncwrite: Add function to write netCDF files.
    * readProbes: Add support for returning the location of each probe.
tappy:
    * Make the code python3 safe.
tide_tools:
    * getObservedMetedata: Tidy the docstring.

--------

Changes since the last release.

buoy_tools:
    * Tidy up all the import statements to be at the beginning of the file.
cst_tools:
    * Tidy up all the import statements to be at the beginning of the file.
    * readCST: Fix the way the end of a vertex is identified to be more
    robust.
ctd_tools:
    * Tidy up all the import statements to be at the beginning of the file.
grid_tools:
    * Tidy up all the import statements to be at the beginning of the file.
    * Remove the plotUnstructuredGrid, plotUnstructuredGridProjected and
    plotCoast functions as they were pretty basic and only replicated half
    a dozen lines of matplotlib which is better demonstrated in the examples
    given on the wiki.
ocean_tools:
    * pea: new function to calculate the potential energy anomaly from
    temperature, salinity and depth.
    * zbar: new function to calculate the depth averaged value of an input.
    Naive implementation with a loop which can almost certainly be optimised
    significantly.
    * dens_jackett: add support for arrays of pressure as opposed to single
    values.
    * _tests: add a test for the conversion from depth to pressure using the
    output of the pressure2depth.
process_FVCOM_results:
    * Tidy up all the import statements to be at the beginning of the file.
read_FVCOM_results:
    * Tidy up all the import statements to be at the beginning of the file.
    * elems2nodes: fix the function to support n-dimensional arrays (rather
    than being limited to 2D arrays).
stats_tools:
    * Tidy up all the import statements to be at the beginning of the file.
tidal_ellipse:
    * Tidy up all the import statements to be at the beginning of the file.
tide_tools:
    * gregorianDate: fix issue with some month numbers being returned as zero.

README.md
    * Remove some old dependencies (mainly to do with the shapefile plotting
    routine which has now been removed).
    * Also update the list of functions provided by each group of functions.


20140422
--------

Changes since the last release.

buoy_tools:
    * getCTDMetadata: read CTD metadata from an SQLite3 data base.
    * getCTDData: extract CTD data from an SQLite3 dadta base.
cst_tools:
    * readCST: read SMS CST files into a dict for each specified arc.
img2xyz:
    * rgb2z: Crude attempt at converting RGB images to depths.
ll2utm:
    * Code clean up and ability to work with arrays. Also included some tests
    to ensure further changes don't negatively impact on the results.
read_FVCOM_results:
    * ncread: wrapper around readFVCOM with a more generic name since the
    function is not specific to FVCOM, but works with any netCDF file.
    * readProbes: read in FVCOM probes outputs (both 1 and 2D data).

README.md:
    * Added new functions to the list of functions.


20140221
--------

grid_tools:
    * parseUnstructuredGridGMSH: new function to read GMSH unstructured grids.
    * OSGB36toWGS84: new function to convert from British National Grid to
    spherical (WGS84).
    * connectivity: new function to calculate the connectivity of an
    unstructured grid (e.g. find the boundary).
ll2utm:
    * Update the function to use arrays of positions rather than single
    positions.
    * Also add some tests to make sure things don't break with the new
    changes.
ocean_tools:
    * cond2salt: new function to convert conductivity to salinity (assuming
    temperature constant at 25 Celsius).
read_FVCOM_results:
    * readFVCOM: update to try aggregating multiple files along a dimension
    called 'time' if unsuccessful with the automatic aggregation.

README.md:
    * Add example code section for some simple plots.
