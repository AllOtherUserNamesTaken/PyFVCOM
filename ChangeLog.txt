--------

Changes since the last release.

buoy_tools:
    * getCTDMetadata: read CTD metadata from an SQLite3 data base.
    * getCTDData: extract CTD data from an SQLite3 dadta base.
cst_tools:
    * readCST: read SMS CST files into a dict for each specified arc.
img2xyz:
    * rgb2z: Crude attempt at converting RGB images to depths.
ll2utm:
    * Code clean up and ability to work with arrays. Also included some tests
    to ensure further changes don't negatively impact on the results.
read_FVCOM_results:
    * ncread: wrapper around readFVCOM with a more generic name since the
    function is not specific to FVCOM, but works with any netCDF file.
    * readProbes: read in FVCOM probes outputs (both 1 and 2D data).

README.md:
    * Added new functions to the list of functions.

grid_tools:
    * parseUnstructuredGridGMSH: new function to read GMSH unstructured grids.
    * OSGB36toWGS84: new function to convert from British National Grid to
    spherical (WGS84).
    * connectivity: new function to calculate the connectivity of an
    unstructured grid (e.g. find the boundary).
ll2utm:
    * Update the function to use arrays of positions rather than single
    positions.
    * Also add some tests to make sure things don't break with the new
    changes.
ocean_tools:
    * cond2salt: new function to convert conductivity to salinity (assuming
    temperature constant at 25 Celsius).
read_FVCOM_results:
    * readFVCOM: update to try aggregating multiple files along a dimension
    called 'time' if unsuccessful with the automatic aggregation.

README.md:
    * Add example code section for some simple plots.
